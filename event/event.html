 <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    In the summer of 2019, culinary expert and internationally recognized genius Brandon Le visited a local mom-and-pop shop with a very humble menu of just fried chicken. Expecting a lousy excuse for the classic crunch, Brandon was shocked when he bit into their chicken. The skin was crunchy, the meat was juicy, anything you could want in fried chicken, the shop had it. Ever since that faithful summer day, Brandon and his team has vowed to find culinary talent that could rival that mom-and-pop shop. Do you have what it takes to become the next chicken champion?
